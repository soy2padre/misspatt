abstract = {In prevention studies, researchers often investigate the incidence of initial drug experimentation or other drug use milestones and its relationship to individual attributes such as the level of parental monitoring or rebelliousness. In this case, survival analysis is the methodology of choice. Survival analysis methods deal efficiently with data from individuals who leave the study prematurely and do not return. However often individuals do return to the study. The application of survival analysis to a situation in which individuals miss assessments and later return is nonstandard. The authors begin with an illustration of how intermittent missed assessments combined with prototypical questions lead to knowledge of the initiation times only up to a range of time intervals. Next, 2 missing data procedures, artificial censoring and multiple imputation, for dealing with the imprecision in timing caused by intermittent missed assessments are discussed. In the last section, both missing data procedures are applied to each of 2 sets of data collected from a 6-yr epidemiological study of children. Data from a subset of 694 girls was used. To compare the 2 procedures the authors compare the results of subsequent use of discrete time survival analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Investigated the problem of missing item responses in tests and questionnaires when using factor analysis to study the structure of the items. Multidimensional rating scale data were simulated, and item scores were deleted under D. B. Rubin"s (1976) MAR and MCAR definitions. Five imputation methods, the EM algorithm, and listwise deletion were implemented to deal with the item score missingness. Factor analysis was done on the complete data matrix, and on the seven data matrices that resulted from the application of each of the missingness methods. The factor loadings structure based on EM best approximated the loadings structure obtained from the complete data. Imputation of the mean per person across the available scores for that person was the best alternative to EM . It is recommended to researchers to use this simple method when EM is not available or when expertise to implement EM is lacking. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Missing data are common in studies that rely on multiple informant data to evaluate relationships among variables for distinguishable individuals clustered within groups. Estimation of structural equation models using raw data allows for incomplete data, and so all groups can be retained for analysis even if only 1 member of a group contributes data. Statistical inference is based on the assumption that data are missing completely at random or missing at random. Importantly, whether or not data are missing is assumed to be independent of the missing data. A saturated correlates model that incorporates correlates of the missingness or the missing data into an analysis and multiple imputation that might also use such correlates offer advantages over the standard implementation of SEM when data are not missing at random because these approaches could result in a data analysis problem for which the missingness is ignorable. This article considers these approaches in an analysis of family data to assess the sensitivity of parameter estimates and statistical inferences to assumptions about missing data, a strategy that could be easily implemented using SEM software.

abstract = {When using multiple imputation in the analysis of incomplete data, a prominent guideline suggests that more than 10 imputed data values are seldom needed. This article calls into question the optimism of this guideline and illustrates that important quantities (e.g., p values, confidence interval half-widths, and estimated fractions of missing information) suffer from substantial imprecision with a small number of imputations. Substantively, a researcher can draw categorically different conclusions about null hypothesis rejection, estimation precision, and missing information in distinct multiple imputation runs for the same data and analysis with few imputations. This article explores the factors associated with this imprecision, demonstrates that precision improves by increasing the number of imputations, and provides practical guidelines for choosing a reasonable number of imputations to reduce imprecision for each of these quantities.

Our derivations are corroborated with results from a small simulation study.

abstract = {Latent variable models are used in biological and social sciences to investigate characteristics that are not directly measurable. The generation of individual scores of latent variables can simplify subsequent analyses. However, missing measurements in real data complicate the calculation of scores. Missing observations also result in different latent variable scores having different degrees of accuracy which should be taken into account in subsequent analyses. This manuscript presents a publicly available software tool that addresses both these problems, using as an example a dataset consisting of multiple ratings for ADHD symptomatology in children. The program computes latent variable scores with accompanying accuracy indices, under a 'user-specified' structural equation model, in data with missing data patterns. Since structural equation models encompass factor models, it can also be used for calculating factor scores. The program, documentation and a tutorial, containing worked examples and specimen input and output files, is available at http://statgen.iop.kcl.ac.uk/lsc .},

We assume that the missing data are missing at random (MAR) or missing completely at random (MCAR) throughout. Previous theoretical investigations in the literature have focused only on missing covariates or missing responses, but not both. Here, we consider theoretical properties of the estimates under three different estimation settings: complete case (CC) analysis, a complete response (CR) analysis that involves an analysis of those subjects with only completely observed responses, and the all case (AC) analysis, which is an analysis based on all of the cases. Under each scenario, we derive general expressions for the likelihood and devise estimation schemes based on the EM algorithm. We carry out a theoretical investigation of the three estimation methods in the normal linear model and analytically characterize the loss of information for each method, as well as derive and compare the asymptotic variances for each method assuming the missing data are MAR or MCAR. In addition, a theoretical investigation of bias for the CC method is also carried out. A simulation study and real dataset are given to illustrate the methodology.

abstract = {Two classes of modern missing data procedures, maximum likelihood (ML) and multiple imputation (MI), tend to yield similar results when implemented in comparable ways. In either approach, it is possible to include auxiliary variables solely for the purpose of improving the missing data procedure. A simulation was presented to assess the potential costs and benefits of a restrictive strategy, which makes minimal use of auxiliary variables, versus an inclusive strategy, which makes liberal use of such variables. The simulation showed that the inclusive strategy is to be greatly preferred. With an inclusive strategy not only is there a reduced chance of inadvertently omitting an important cause of missingness, there is also the possibility of noticeable gains in terms of increased efficiency and reduced bias, with only minor costs. As implemented in currently available software, the ML approach tends to encourage the use of a restrictive strategy, whereas the MI approach makes it relatively simple to use an inclusive strategy.},

We discuss 2 ways to calculate power when data are MCAR, one based on multigroup analysis and summary statistics, the other based on transformed raw data. The latter method is quite simple to carry out. Four examples are presented. This article is limited to data MCAR. Generally MCAR is a strong assumption. We demonstrate that results of power analyses based on the MCAR assumption are not informative if the data are actually missing at random.

The impacts of 4 independent variables were examined (missing data algorithm, missing data rate, sample size, and distribution shape) on 4 outcome measures (parameter estimate bias, parameter estimate efficiency, standard error coverage, and model rejection rates). Across missing completely at random and missing at random patterns, FIML parameter estimates involved less bias and were generally more efficient than those of ad hoc missing data techniques. However, similar to complete-data maximum-likelihood estimation in structural equation modeling, standard errors were negatively biased and model rejection rates were inflated. Simulation results suggest that recently developed correctives for missing data (e.g., rescaled statistics and the bootstrap) can mitigate problems that stem from nonnormal data.},

Despite the widespread availability of theoretically justified methods, researchers in many disciplines still rely on subpar strategies that either eliminate incomplete cases or impute the missing scores with a single set of replacement values. This article provides readers with a nontechnical overview of some key issues from the missing data literature and demonstrates several of the techniques that methodologists currently recommend. This article begins by describing Rubin's missing data mechanisms. After a brief discussion of popular ad hoc approaches, the article provides a more detailed description of five analytic approaches that have received considerable attention in the missing data literature: maximum likelihood estimation, multiple imputation, the selection model, the shared parameter model, and the pattern mixture model.

abstract = {The past decade has seen a noticeable shift in missing data handling techniques that assume a missing at random (MAR) mechanism, where the propensity for missing data on an outcome is related to other analysis variables. Although MAR is often reasonable, there are situations where this assumption is unlikely to hold, leading to biased parameter estimates. One such example is a longitudinal study of substance use where participants with the highest frequency of use also have the highest likelihood of attrition, even after controlling for other correlates of missingness. There is a large body of literature on missing not at random (MNAR) analysis models for longitudinal data, particularly in the field of biostatistics. Because these methods allow for a relationship between the outcome variable and the propensity for missing data, they require a weaker assumption about the missing data mechanism. This article describes 2 classic MNAR modeling approaches for longitudinal data: the selection model and the pattern mixture model. To date, these models have been slow to migrate to the social sciences, in part because they required complicated custom computer programs. These models are now quite easy to estimate in popular structural equation modeling programs, particularly Mplus. The purpose of this article is to describe these MNAR modeling frameworks and to illustrate their application on a real data set. Despite their potential advantages, MNAR-based analyses are not without problems and also rely on untestable assumptions. This article offers practical advice for implementing and choosing among different longitudinal models.},

abstract = {Recent missing data studies have argued in favor of an "inclusive analytic strategy" that incorporates auxiliary variables into the estimation routine, and Graham (2003) outlined methods for incorporating auxiliary variables into structural equation analyses. In practice, the auxiliary variables often have missing values, so it is reasonable to ask whether the inclusion of such variables will improve the estimation of model parameters. Simulation results indicated that the proportion of missing data and the missing data mechanism of the auxiliary variables had little impact on bias. Even when an auxiliary variable was missing not at random, bias was relegated to the auxiliary variable portion of the model, and did not propagate into the model of substantive interest. The study results suggest that the inclusion of an auxiliary variable is beneficial, even if the auxiliary variable has a substantial proportion of missing data.

We outline 3 latent variable model specifications for interaction analyses with missing data. These models apply procedures from the latent variable interaction literature to analyses with a single indicator per construct (e.g., a regression analysis with scale scores). We also discuss multiple imputation for interaction effects, emphasizing an approach that applies standard imputation procedures to the product of 2 raw score predictors. We thoroughly describe the process of probing interaction effects with maximum likelihood and multiple imputation. For both missing data handling techniques, we outline centering and transformation strategies that researchers can implement in popular software packages, and we use a series of real data analyses to illustrate these methods.

abstract = {Two methods, direct maximum likelihood (ML) and the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, can be used to obtain ML parameter estimates for structural equation models with missing data (MD). Although the 2 methods frequently produce identical parameter estimates, it may be easier to satisfy missing at random assumptions using EM. However, no single value of N is applicable to the EM covariance matrix, and this may compromise inferences gained from the model fit statistic and parameter standard errors. The purpose of this study was to identify a value of N that provides accurate inferences when using EM. If all confirmatory factor analysis model indicators have MD, results suggest that the minimum N per covariance term yields honest Type 1 error rates. If MD are restricted to a subset of indicators, the minimum N per variance works well. With respect to standard errors, the harmonic mean N per variance term produces honest confidence interval coverage rates. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {Factor score estimation is a controversial topic in psychometrics, and the estimation of factor scores from exploratory factor models has historically received a great deal of attention. However, both confirmatory factor models and the existence of missing data have generally been ignored in this debate. This article presents a simulation study that compares the reliability of sum scores, regression-based and expected posterior methods for factor score estimation for confirmatory factor models in the presence of missing data. Although all methods perform reasonably well with complete data, expected posterior-weighted (full) maximum likelihood methods are significantly more reliable than sum scores and regression estimators in the presence of missing data. Factor score reliability for complete data can be predicted by Guttman's 1955 formula for factor communality. Furthermore, factor score reliability for incomplete data can be reasonably approximated by communality raised to the 1/1-P (Missing) power. An empirical demonstration shows that the full maximum likelihood method best preserves the relationship between nicotine dependence and a genetic predictor under missing data. Implications and recommendations for applied research are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {In longitudinal education studies, assuming that dropout and missing data occur completely at random is often unrealistic. When the probability of dropout depends on covariates and observed responses (called missing at random [MAR]), or on values of responses that are missing (called informative or not missing at random [NMAR]), inappropriate analysis can cause biased estimates. NMAR requires explicit modeling of the missingness process together with the response variable. In this article, we review assumptions needed for consistent estimation of hierarchical linear growth models using common missing-data approaches. We also suggest a joint model for the longitudinal data and missingness process to handle the situation where data are NMAR. The different approaches are applied to the NELS:88 study, as well as simulated data. Results from the NELS:88 analyses were similar between the MAR and NMAR models. However, use of listwise deletion and mean imputation resulted in significant bias, both for the NELS:88 study and simulated data. Simulation results showed that incorrectly assuming MAR leads to greater bias for the growth-factor variance–covariance matrix than for the growth factor means, the former being severe with as little as 10{\%} missing data and the latter with 40{\%} missing data when departure from MAR is strong.},

A revised generalized least squares (GLS) method for synthesizing correlations, weighted-covariance GLS (W-COV GLS), was compared with univariate weighting with untransformed correlations (univariate r) and univariate weighting with Fisher's z-transformed correlations (univariate z). These 3 methods were crossed with listwise and pairwise deletion. Univariate z and W-COV GLS performed similarly, with W-COV GLS providing slightly better estimation of parameters and more correct model rejection rates. Missing not at random data produced high levels of relative bias in correlation and model parameter estimates and higher incorrect SEM model rejection rates. Pairwise deletion resulted in inflated standard errors for all synthesis methods and higher incorrect rejection rates for the SEM model with univariate weighting procedures.},

abstract = {Conventional wisdom in missing data research dictates adding variables to the missing data model when those variables are predictive of (a) missingness and (b) the variables containing missingness. However, it has recently been shown that adding variables that are correlated with variables containing missingness, whether or not they are related to missingness, can substantially improve estimation (bias and efficiency). Including large numbers of these "auxiliary" variables is straightforward for researchers who use multiple imputation. However, what is the researcher to do if 1 of the full-information maximum likelihood (FIML)/structural equation modeling (SEM) procedures is the analysis of choice? This article suggests 2 models for SEM analysis with missing data, and presents simulation results to show that both models provide estimation that is clearly as good as analysis with the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, and by extension, multiple imputation. One of these models, the saturated correlates model, also provides good estimates of model fit. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

The method is applicable to data sets where values are missing on any combination of the dependent and independent variables. Further, the missing data need not be missing in a completely random fashion. The estimates are constructed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure known as Gibbs Sampling. The important issues of the convergence properties of the Gibbs sampler, the effect of the choice of a reference prior, and the empirical coverage probabilities of the estimates are considered in detail.

Examples that are considered in this paper are the switches between different states associated with premenstrual syndrome, hourly fluctuations in affect during a major depressive episode, and shifts between a “hot hand” and a “cold hand” in a top athlete. We model these processes with the regime switching state-space model proposed by Kim (J. Econom. 60:1–22, 1994), which results in both maximum likelihood estimates for the model parameters and estimates of the latent variables and the discrete states of the process. However, the current algorithm cannot handle missing data, which limits its applicability to psychological data. Moreover, the performance of standard errors for the purpose of making inferences about the parameter estimates is yet unknown. In this paper we modify Kim's algorithm so it can handle missing data and we perform a simulation study to investigate its performance in (relatively) short time series in cases of different kinds of missing data and in case of complete data. Finally, we apply the regime switching state-space model to the three empirical data sets described above. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

For this approach, subjects are first divided into groups depending on their missing-data pattern and then variables based on these groups are used as model covariates. In this way, researchers are able to examine the effect of missing-data patterns on the outcome (or outcomes) of interest. Furthermore, overall estimates can be obtained by averaging over the missing-data patterns.

Notwithstanding ease of analysis due to computers, the appropriate use of factor analysis requires a series of thoughtful researcher judgments. These judgments directly affect results and interpretations. The authors examine across studies (a) the decisions made while conducting exploratory factor analyses (N = 60) and (b) the information reported from the analyses. In doing so, they present a review of the current status of factor analytic practice, including comment on common errors in use and reporting. Recommendations are proffered for future practice as regards analytic decisions and reporting in empirical research.},

abstract = {A desirable method for imputing missing data when the missing data mechanism is ignorable is random imputation. Imputation generally involves regressing each variable with missing data onto all the other variables. Single random imputation involves creating one data set in which each of the missing values is imputed by adding a random error term from the residual distribution of each imputed variable. Adding a random error term reduces the bias in standard errors of parameter estimates ordinarily observed under traditional methods of imputation (Schafer, 1997). However, even single random imputation produces standard errors that are generally biased downward and parameter estimates that are relatively inefficient. Improvements in bias and efficiency occur with multiple random imputation in which the imputation process is done more than once, producing multiple data sets whose parameter estimates and standard errors are averaged (Rubin, 1987). Many structural equation modeling programs (e.g., AMOS; Arbuckle, 1997) are now able to compute multiple random imputations for missing data. In this note, a suggestion is given based on simple random sampling theory as to how one can determine the number of imputations to perform.

abstract = {Popular theories in political science regarding opinion-changing behavior postulate the existence of one or both of two broad categories of people: those with stable opinions over time; and those who appear to hold no solid opinion and, when asked to make a choice, do so seemingly at random. The model presented here explores evidence for a third category: durable changers. People in this group will change their opinions in a rational, informed manner after being exposed to new information. Survey data collected at four time points over nearly two years track Swiss citizens' readiness to support pollution- reduction policies. The authors analyzed the data using finite mixture models that allow estimation of the percentage in the poluation falling in each category for each question as well as the frequency of certain types of relevant behaviors within each category. These models extend the finite mixture model structure used in J. L. Hill and H. Kriesi (200la,b) to accommodate missing response data. This extension increases the sample size by nearly 60{\%} and weakens the missing-data assumptions required. The authors describe augmented models and fitting algorithms corresponding to different assumptions about the missing-data mechanism as well as the differences in results obtained.

In this paper, the weighted estimating equation method (Qi et al., 2005) [25] is used to extend the so-called unified estimation procedure (Chen et al., 2002) [4] for linear transformation models to the case of missing covariates. The non-missingness probability is estimated nonparametrically by the kernel smoothing technique. Under missing at random, the proposed estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal, with the asymptotic variance estimated consistently by the usual plug-in method. Moreover, the proposed estimators are more efficient than the weighted estimators with the inverse of true non-missingness probability as weight. Finite sample performance of the estimators is examined via simulation and a real dataset is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {Incomplete or missing data is a common problem in almost all areas of empirical research. It is well known that simple and ad hoc methods such as complete case analysis or mean imputation can lead to biased and/or inefficient estimates. The method of maximum likelihood works well; however, when the missing data mechanism is not one of missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR), it too can result in incorrect inference. Statistical tests for MCAR have been proposed, but these are restricted to a certain class of problems. The idea of sensitivity analysis as a means to detect the missing data mechanism has been proposed in the statistics literature in conjunction with selection models where conjointly the data and missing data mechanism are modeled. Our approach is different here in that we do not model the missing data mechanism but use the data at hand to examine the sensitivity of a given model to the missing data mechanism. Our methodology is meant to raise a flag for researchers when the assumptions of MCAR (or MAR) do not hold. To our knowledge, no specific proposal for sensitivity analysis has been set forth in the area of structural equation models (SEM). This article gives a specific method for performing postmodeling sensitivity analysis using a statistical test and graphs. A simulation study is performed to assess the methodology in the context of structural equation models. This study shows success of the method, especially when the sample size is 300 or more and the percentage of missing data is 20{\%} or more. The method is also used to study a set of real data measuring physical and social self-concepts in 463 Nigerian adolescents using a factor analysis model.

abstract = {Developmental science rests on describing, explaining, and optimizing intraindividual changes and, hence, empirically requires longitudinal research. Problems of missing data arise in most longitudinal studies, thus creating challenges for interpreting the substance and structure of intraindividual change. Using a sample of reports of longitudinal studies obtained from three flagship developmental journals—Child Development, Developmental Psychology, and Journal of Research on Adolescence—we examined the number of longitudinal studies reporting missing data and the missing data techniques used. Of the 100 longitudinal studies sampled, 57 either reported having missing data or had discrepancies in sample sizes reported for different analyses. The majority of these studies (82{\%}) used missing data techniques that are statistically problematic (either listwise deletion or pairwise deletion) and not among the methods recommended by statisticians (i.e., the direct maximum likelihood method and the multiple imputation method). Implications of these results for developmental theory and application, and the need for understanding the consequences of using statistically inappropriate missing data techniques with actual longitudinal data sets, are discussed.

abstract = {Treatment noncompliance and missing outcomes at posttreatment assessments are common problems in field experiments in naturalistic settings. Although the two complications often occur simultaneously, statistical methods that address both complications have not been routinely considered in data analysis practice in the prevention research field. This paper shows that identification and estimation of causal treatment effects considering both noncompliance and missing outcomes can be relatively easily conducted under various missing data assumptions. We review a few assumptions on missing data in the presence of noncompliance, including the latent ignorability proposed by Frangakis and Rubin (Biometrika 86:365–379, 1999), and show how these assumptions can be used in the parametric complier average causal effect (CACE) estimation framework. As an easy way of sensitivity analysis, we propose the use of alternative missing data assumptions, which will provide a range of causal effect estimates. In this way, we are less likely to settle with a possibly biased causal effect estimate based on a single assumption. We demonstrate how alternative missing data assumptions affect identification of causal effects, focusing on the CACE. The data from the Johns Hopkins School Intervention Study (Ialongo et al., Am J Community Psychol 27:599–642, 1999) will be used as an example.

abstract = {Missing data, such as item responses in multilevel data, are ubiquitous in educational research settings. Researchers in the item response theory (IRT) context have shown that ignoring such missing data can create problems in the estimation of the IRT model parameters. Consequently, several imputation methods for dealing with missing item data have been proposed and shown to be effective when applied with traditional IRT models. Additionally, a nonimputation direct likelihood analysis has been shown to be an effective tool for handling missing observations in clustered data settings. This study investigates the performance of six simple imputation methods, which have been found to be useful in other IRT contexts, versus a direct likelihood analysis, in multilevel data from educational settings. Multilevel item response data were simulated on the basis of two empirical data sets, and some of the item scores were deleted, such that they were missing either completely at random or simply at random. An explanatory IRT model was used for modeling the complete, incomplete, and imputed data sets. We showed that direct likelihood analysis of the incomplete data sets produced unbiased parameter estimates that were comparable to those from a complete data analysis. Multiple-imputation approaches of the two-way mean and corrected item mean substitution methods displayed varying degrees of effectiveness in imputing data that in turn could produce unbiased parameter estimates. The simple random imputation, adjusted random imputation, item means substitution, and regression imputation methods seemed to be less effective in imputing missing item scores in multilevel data settings.

In this article, a new estimation method is proposed, which leads to consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for all parameters in a linear latent variate model, where the missing mechanism depends on the latent variables and no concrete functional form for the missing-data mechanism is used in estimation. The method to be proposed is a type of multi-sample analysis with or without mean structures, and hence, it is easy to implement.

For LCMs with missing data, the EM algorithm provides parameter estimates that display relatively little bias even when the missing mechanism violates the randomness conditions.

Bootstrap samples of 50, 100, and 200 were drawn from 3 sets of actual field data on academic achievement, Likert-type ratings, and psychological traits. Nonrandomly missing data were created, and the parameter estimates were compared with those obtained from the same samples with no missing data. Results indicate that 3 imputation procedures produced biased estimates of R–2 and both regression weights.

abstract = {A Bayesian approach is developed for analyzing nonlinear structural equation models with non-ignorable missing data. The nonignorable missingness mechanism is specified by a logistic regression model. A hybrid algorithm that combines the Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used to produce the joint Bayesian estimates of structural parameters, latent variables, parameters in the nonignorable missing model, as well as their standard errors estimates. A goodness-of-fit statistic for assessing the plausibility of the posited nonlinear structural equation model is introduced, and a procedure for computing the Bayes factor for model comparison is developed via path sampling. Results obtained with respect to different missing data models, and different prior inputs are compared via simulation studies. In particular, it is shown that in the presence of nonignorable missing data, results obtained by the proposed method with a nonignorable missing data model are significantly better than those that are obtained under the missing at random assumption. A real example is presented to illustrate the newly developed Bayesian methodologies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {By only specifying the conditional mean and variance functions of the response variable given covariates, the quasi-likelihood can produce valid semiparametric inference for regression parameter in generalized linear models (GLMs). However, in many studies, auxiliary information is available as moment restrictions of the marginal distribution of the response variable and covariates. We propose the combined quasi and empirical likelihood (CQEL) to incorporate such auxiliary information to improve the efficiency of parameter estimation of the quasi-likelihood in GLMs with missing responses. We show that, when assuming responses are missing at random (MAR), the CQEL estimator achieves better efficiency than the maximum quasi-likelihood (MQL) estimator due to utilization of the auxiliary information. When there is no auxiliary information, we show that the CQEL estimator of the mean response is more efficient than the existing imputation estimators. Based on the asymptotic property of the CQEL estimator, we also develop Wilks' type tests and corresponding confidence regions for the regression parameter and mean response. The merits of the CQEL are further illustrated through simulation studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {In clinical and epidemiological studies, matched case-control designs have been used extensively to investigate the relationships between disease/response and exposure/ covariate. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, some covariates may not be observed for all study subjects and missing covariate information may create bias and reduce the efficiency of the parameter estimates. We explore the use of profile empirical likelihood (EL) to cope with this situation by combining unbiased estimating equations when the number of estimating equations is greater than the number of unknown parameters. For high dimensional covariates, we propose a weighted conditional likelihood (WCL) method to solve the computational problem of the profile EL method. The proposed EL and WCL methods can achieve semiparametric efficiency if the probability of missingness is correctly specified. Based on the EL and WCL functions, we also develop Wilks' type tests and corresponding confidence regions for the model parameters.

abstract = {Growth mixture models (GMMs) with nonignorable missing data have drawn increasing attention in research communities but have not been fully studied. The goal of this article is to propose and to evaluate a Bayesian method to estimate the GMMs with latent class dependent missing data. An extended GMM is first pre- sented in which class probabilities depend on some observed explanatory variables and data missingness depends on both the explanatory variables and a latent class variable. A full Bayesian method is then proposed to estimate the model. Through the data augmentation method, conditional posterior distributions for all model parameters and missing data are obtained. A Gibbs sampling procedure is then used to generate Markov chains of model parameters for statistical inference. The application of the model and the method is first demonstrated through the analysis of mathematical ability growth data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, 1997). A simulation study considering 3 main factors (the sample size, the class probability, and the missing data mechanism) is then conducted and the results show that the proposed Bayesian estimation approach performs very well under the studied conditions. Finally, some implications of this study, including the misspecified missingness mechanism, the sample size, the sensitivity of the model, the number of latent classes, the model comparison, and the future directions of the approach, are discussed.

Gollob (1999) established that the t test can be conservative for this design-yielding hypothesis test P values that are too large or CIs that are too wide for the relevant local population. This article develops a less conservative approach to local population inference, one based on the logic of B. Efron's (1979) nonparametric bootstrap. The resulting randomization bootstrap is then compared with an established approach to local population inference, that based on randomization or permutation tests. Finally, the importance of local population inference is established by reference to the distinction between statistical and scientific inference.},

This covers the usual settings with fully observed data and the nonparametric regression model as special cases. We first develop a test for additivity of the nonparametric part in the complete data model. The test statistic is based on the difference between two empirical estimators that estimate the errors in two ways: the first uses a local polynomial smoother for the nonparametric part; the second estimates the additive components by a marginal integration estimator derived from the local polynomial smoother. We present a uniform stochastic expansion of the empirical estimator based on the marginal integration estimator, and we derive the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. The transfer principle of Koul et al. (2012) then allows a direct adaptation of the results to the case when responses are missing at random. We examine the performance of the tests in a small simulation study. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {This article uses a general latent variable framework to study a series of models for nonignorable missingness due to dropout. Nonignorable missing data modeling acknowledges that missingness may depend not only on covariates and observed outcomes at previous time points as with the standard missing at random assumption, but also on latent variables such as values that would have been observed (missing outcomes), developmental trends (growth factors), and qualitatively different types of development (latent trajectory classes). These alternative predictors of missing data can be explored in a general latent variable framework with the Mplus program. A flexible new model uses an extended pattern-mixture approach where missingness is a function of latent dropout classes in combination with growth mixture modeling. A new selection model not only allows an influence of the outcomes on missingness but allows this influence to vary across classes. Model selection is discussed. The missing data models are applied to longitudinal data from the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study, the largest antidepressant clinical trial in the United States to date. Despite the importance of this trial, STAR*D growth model analyses using nonignorable missing data techniques have not been explored until now. The STAR*D data are shown to feature distinct trajectory classes, including a low class corresponding to substantial improvement in depression, a minority class with a U-shaped curve corresponding to transient improvement, and a high class corresponding to no improvement. The analyses provide a new way to assess drug efficiency in the presence of dropout.},

abstract = {Randomised controlled trial (RCT)-based cost-effectiveness analyses, which are prone to missing data, are increasingly used in healthcare technology assessment. This has highlighted the need for appropriate methodological approaches to the handling of missing data. This paper reviews missing data methodology used in RCT-based cost-effectiveness analyses since 2003. Complete case analysis, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions, is still the most popular approach and its use has increased with time. The degree of missing data in cost-effectiveness analyses was often poorly reported and the methodology was often unclear. Reporting of missing data sensitivity analyses would improve article transparency. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2013 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},

abstract = {For the past 25 years, methodological advances have been made in missing data treatment. Most published work has focused on missing data in dependent variables under various conditions. The present study seeks to fill the void by comparing two approaches for handling missing data in categorical covariates in logistic regression: the expectation-maximization (EM) method of weights and multiple imputation (MI). Sample data are drawn randomly from a population with known characteristics. Missing data on covariates are simulated under two conditions: missing completely at random and missing at random with different missing rates. A logistic regression model was fit to each sample using either the EM or MI approach. The performance of these two approaches is compared on four criteria: bias, efficiency, coverage, and rejection rate. Results generally favored MI over EM. Practical issues such as implementation, inclusion of continuous covariates, and interactions between covariates are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated in comparison with 3 other commonly used methods for dealing with missing values, making use of actual field data from a national survey of 3,220 12–24 yr olds in the Netherlands. The emphasis is on 2 aspects of global effectiveness: (1) the accuracy in estimating various parameters at the same time and (2) the accuracy in estimating, for Likert-type scales with different psychometric characteristics, these various parameters under different conditions, such as different numbers of respondents (1,674; 400; and 100) and different distributions of missing values (2 random and 3 nonrandom situations). The results indicate that this new relative mean substitution approach globally produced the most accurate estimates, mainly because of the more accurate estimation of the variances and the sensitivity to items with deviating means, provided that the Likert-type scales are sufficiently homogeneous. The SPSS for Windows setup for computing relative mean is appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

A discussion is initially provided, from a formal logic standpoint, of the distinction between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. This distinction is used to argue then that testing for lack of these group distributional differences is not a test for MCAR, and an example is given. The view is next presented that the desirability of MCAR has been frequently overrated in empirical research.

abstract = {Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is used routinely in the development and validation of assessment instruments. One of the most significant challenges when one is performing EFA is determining how many factors to retain. Parallel analysis (PA) is an effective stopping rule that compares the eigenvalues of randomly generated data with those for the actual data. PA takes into account sampling error, and at present it is widely considered the best available method. We introduce a variant of PA that goes even further by reproducing the observed correlation matrix rather than generating random data. Comparison data (CD) with known factorial structure are first generated using 1 factor, and then the number of factors is increased until the reproduction of the observed eigenvalues fails to improve significantly. We evaluated the performance of PA, CD with known factorial structure, and 7 other techniques in a simulation study spanning a wide range of challenging data conditions. In terms of accuracy and robustness across data conditions, the CD technique outperformed all other methods, including a nontrivial superiority to PA. We provide program code to implement the CD technique, which requires no more specialized knowledge or skills than performing PA.},

abstract = {Normal theory maximum likelihood (ML) is by far the most popular estimation and testing method used in structural equation modeling (SEM), and it is the default in most SEM programs. Even though this approach assumes multivariate normality of the data, its use can be justified on the grounds that it is fairly robust to the violations of the distributional assumptions under some conditions. In support of this claim, a large literature exists outlining conditions under which the ML chi-square retains its asymptotic distribution even under nonnormality. The most important of these conditions is specifying a model in which the exogenous variables presumed to be uncorrelated (e.g., factors and errors in a confirmatory factor analysis model) are also statistically independent. The goal of this article is to point out that these conditions were developed for complete data, and in fact no longer ensure robustness when the data are both nonnormal and incomplete. This lack of robustness is illustrated both mathematically and empirically. Violation becomes more severe when the data are highly nonnormal and when a higher proportion of data is missing. It is concluded that if the proportion of missing data is greater than about 10{\%}, robustness of the ML chi-square with incomplete nonnormal data cannot be counted on, even if the necessary assumptions such as independence are made. Other approaches to model testing are to be preferred in this case. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Reports an error in "A two-stage approach to missing data: Theory and application to auxiliary variables" by Victoria Savalei and Peter M. Bentler (Structural Equation Modeling, 2009[Jul], Vol 16[3], 477-497). In the original article, there was an error in Equation 5. The corrected Equation 5 is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2010-12086-003[/rid]). A well-known ad-hoc approach to conducting structural equation modeling with missing data is to obtain a saturated maximum likelihood (ML) estimate of the population covariance matrix and then to use this estimate in the complete data ML fitting function to obtain parameter estimates. This 2-stage (TS) approach is appealing because it minimizes a familiar function while being only marginally less efficient than the full information ML (FIML) approach. Additional advantages of the TS approach include that it allows for easy incorporation of auxiliary variables and that it is more stable in smaller samples. The main disadvantage is that the standard errors and test statistics provided by the complete data routine will not be correct. Empirical approaches to finding the right corrections for the TS approach have failed to provide unequivocal solutions. In this article, correct standard errors and test statistics for the TS approach with missing completely at random and missing at random normally distributed data are developed and studied. The new TS approach performs well in all conditions, is only marginally less efficient than the FIML approach (and is sometimes more efficient), and has good coverage. Additionally, the residual-based TS statistic outperforms the FIML test statistic in smaller samples. The TS method is thus a viable alternative to FIML, especially in small samples, and its further study is encouraged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {This article proposes a new approach to the statistical analysis of pairwise-present covariance structure data. The estimator is based on maximizing the complete data likelihood function, and the associated test statistic and standard errors are corrected for misspecification using Satorra-Bentler corrections. A Monte Carlo study was conducted to compare the proposed method (pairwise maximum likelihood [ML]) to 2 other methods for dealing with incomplete nonnormal data: direct ML estimation with the Yuan-Bentler corrections for nonnormality (direct ML) and the asymptotically distribution free (ADF) method applied to available cases (pairwise ADF). Data were generated from a 4-factor model with 4 indicators per factor; sample size varied from 200 to 5,000; data were either missing completely at random (MCAR) or missing at random (MAR); and the proportion of missingness was either 15{\%} or 30{\%}. Measures of relative performance included model fit, relative accuracy in parameter estimates and their standard errors, and efficiency of parameter estimates. The results generally favored direct ML over either of the pairwise methods, except at N= 5,000, when ADF outperformed both ML methods with MAR data. The inferior performance of the 2 pairwise methods was primarily due to inflated test statistics. Among the unexpected findings was that ADF did better at estimating factor covariances in all conditions, and that MCAR data presented more problems for all methods than did MAR data, in terms of convergence, performance of test statistics, and relative accuracy of parameter estimates.

abstract = {Fraction of missing information $\lambda$j is a useful measure of the impact of missing data on the quality of estimation of a particular parameter. This measure can be computed for all parameters in the model, and it communicates the relative loss of efficiency in the estimation of a particular parameter due to missing data. It has been recommended that researchers working with incomplete data sets routinely report this measure, as it is more informative than percent missing data (Bodner, 2008; Schafer, 1997). However, traditional estimates of $\lambda$j require the implementation of multiple imputation (MI). Many researchers prefer to fit structural equation models using full information maximum likelihood rather than MI. This article demonstrates how to obtain an estimate of $\lambda$j using maximum likelihood estimation routines only and argues that this estimate is superior to the estimate obtained via MI when the number of imputations is small. Interpretation of $\lambda$j is also addressed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

They clear up common misunderstandings regarding the missing at random (MAR) concept. They summarize the evidence against older procedures and, with few exceptions, discourage their use. They present, in both technical and practical language, 2 general approaches that come highly recommended: maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian multiple imputation (MI). Newer developments are discussed, including some for dealing with missing data that are not MAR.

@article{Schafer1998,
abstract = {Analyses of multivariate data are frequently hampered by missing values. Until recently, the only missing-data methods available to most data analysts have been relatively ad hoc practices such as listwise deletion. Recent dramatic advances in theoretical and computational statistics, however, have produced a new generation of flexible procedures with a sound statistical basis. These procedures involve multiple imputation (D. B. Rubin, 1987), a simulation technique that replaces each missing datum with a set of m {\textgreater} 1 plausible values. The m versions of the complete data are analyzed by standard complete-data methods, and the results are combined using simple rules to yield estimates, standard errors, and p-values that formally incorporate missing-data uncertainty. New computational algorithms and software described in a recent book (J. L. Schafer, 1997) allow us to create proper multiple imputations in complex multivariate settings. This article reviews the key ideas of multiple imputation, discusses the software programs currently available, and demonstrates their use on data from the Adolescent Alcohol Prevention Trial (W. B. Hansen and J. W. Graham, 1991). The authors examine the possible effects of a grade 7 intervention on reported alcohol use in grade 9. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Patterns of missing data are reviewed, and some of the common strategies for dealing with them are described. The authors provide an illustration in which data were simulated and evaluate 3 methods of handling missing data: mean substitution, multiple imputation, and full information maximum likelihood. Results suggest that mean substitution is a poor method for handling missing data, whereas both multiple imputation and full information maximum likelihood are recommended alternatives to this approach. The authors suggest that researchers fully consider and report the amount and pattern of missing data and the strategy for handling those data in counseling psychology research and that editors advise researchers of this expectation.},

Yet it is difficult to assess the possible effects of attrition because the outcome status of the dropouts is usually unknown. This article develops methods to assess those effects in studies with dichotomous outcomes, illustrating the methods with randomized experiments in drug abuse treatment, smoking cessation treatment, and alcoholism treatment. The methods include computing the lowest and highest possible effect sizes that could have been observed, enumerating the percent of possible study outcomes below a given threshold, estimating the probability that an outcome beyond any given threshold would be observed if all participants were measured, and constructing attrition analysis plots showing the effects of attrition under varied assumptions. For the kind of study to which they apply, these methods should replace the treatment of missing participants as failures in an "intent-to-treat" analysis. A user-friendly personal computer program is available to implement all of these analyses.},

The effects of 3 independent variables (sample size, missing data mechanism, and distribution shape) were investigated on convergence rate, parameter and standard error estimation, and model fit. The results favored robust ML over LD and pairwise ADF in almost all respects. The exceptions included convergence rates under the most severe nonnormality in the missing not at random (MNAR) condition and recovery of standard error estimates across sample sizes. The results also indicate that nonnormality, small sample size, MNAR, and multicollinearity might adversely affect convergence rate and the validity of statistical inferences concerning parameter estimates and model fit statistics.

These methods are based on few assumptions about the data structure. An empirical data example with simulated missing item scores shows that the new method RF was superior to the methods PM, TW, and MRF in recovering from incomplete data several statistical properties of the original complete data.

These complete data sets are then analyzed by standard statistical software, and the results combined, to give parameter estimates and standard errors that take into account the uncertainty due to the missing data values. This article introduces the idea behind MI, discusses the advantages of MI over existing techniques for addressing missing data, describes how to do MI for real problems, reviews the software available to implement MI, and discusses the results of a simulation study aimed at finding out how assumptions regarding the imputation model affect the parameter estimates provided by MI.},

abstract = {Structural equation models are widely appreciated in behavioral, social, and psychological research to model relations between latent constructs and manifest variables, and to control for measurement errors. Most applications of structural equation models are based on fully observed data that are independently distributed. However, hierarchical data with a correlated structure are common in behavioral research, and very often, missing data are encountered. In this article, we propose a 2-level structural equation model for analyzing hierarchical data with missing entries, and describe a Bayesian approach for estimation and model comparison. We show how to use WinBUGS software to get the solution conveniently. The proposed methodologies are illustrated through a simulation study, and a real application in relation to organizational and management research concerning the study of the interrelationships of the latent constructs about job satisfaction, job responsibility, and life satisfaction for citizens in 43 countries.

Most applications of SEMs are based on fully observed continuous normal data and models with a linear structural equation. However, discrete nonnormal data and missing data are rather common, and sometimes it is necessary to incorporate nonlinear structural equations for assessing the impact of nonlinear terms of the exogenous latent variables to the endogenous latent variables. Moreover, to study the behaviors of different populations, it is necessary to extend from a single sample model to a multisample model. In this article, a maximum likelihood (ML) approach is developed for analyzing a multisample nonlinear structural equation model, in the context of mixed continuous and dichotomous data that involve data that are missing at random. The article demonstrates the newly developed methods for estimation and model comparison by a simulation study, a synthetic data application, and a real application to study latent psychological constructs of job attitude, emotion, and benefit attitude that are related to organizational and management research.

abstract = {Notes that analysts evaluating the strengths of relationships between variables in behavioral science research often contend with the problem of missing data. Analyses are typically performed using data for cases that are either complete in all the variables, or assume that the data are missing at random. Often, these approaches yield biased results. Using empirical data from 330 drug dependent female offenders, the current work explores the implications and consequences of using various statistical models to describe the association of 2 variables, 1 ordinal and 1 dichotomous, in which data are incomplete for the dichotomous variable. These models explicitly reflect the missing data mechanism; models that hypothesize nonignorable nonresponse are given particular attention. Both the statistical fit and substantive consequences of these models are examined. This methodological approach to examining nonignorable nonresponse can be applied to many behavioral science data sets containing an ordinal variable.

abstract = {Semiparametric random censorship (SRC) models (Dikta, 1998) provide an attractive framework for estimating survival functions when censoring indicators are fully or partially available. When there are missing censoring indicators (MCIs), the SRC approach employs a model-based estimate of the conditional expectation of the censoring indicator given the observed time, where the model parameters are estimated using only the complete cases. The multiple imputations approach, on the other hand, utilizes this model-based estimate to impute the missing censoring indicators and form several completed data sets. The Kaplan–Meier and SRC estimators based on the several completed data sets are averaged to arrive at the multiple imputations Kaplan–Meier (MIKM) and the multiple imputations SRC (MISRC) estimators. While the MIKM estimator is asymptotically as efficient as or less efficient than the standard SRC-based estimator that involves no imputations, here we investigate the performance of the MISRC estimator and prove that it attains the benchmark variance set by the SRC-based estimator. We also present numerical results comparing the performances of the estimators under several misspecified models for the above mentioned conditional expectation.

By considering a type of Cholesky decomposition of the precision matrix $\Omega$=$\Psi$́$\Psi$, where $\Psi$ is a lower triangular matrix with positive diagonal elements, we get the MLEs of the covariance matrix and precision matrix and prove that both of them are biased. Based on the MLEs, unbiased estimators of the covariance matrix and precision matrix are obtained. A special group G, which is a subgroup of the group consisting all lower triangular matrices, is introduced. By choosing the left invariant Haar measure on G as a prior, we obtain the closed forms of the best equivariant estimates of $\Omega$ under any of the Stein loss, the entropy loss, and the symmetric loss. Consequently, the MLE of the precision matrix (covariance matrix) is inadmissible under any of the above three loss functions. Some simulation results are given for illustration.

abstract = {Traditional structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques have trouble dealing with incomplete and/or nonnormal data that are often encountered in practice. Yuan and Zhang (2011a) developed a two-stage procedure for SEM to handle nonnormal missing data and proposed four test statistics for overall model evaluation. Although these statistics have been shown to work well with complete data, their performance for incomplete data has not been investigated in the context of robust statistics. Focusing on a linear growth curve model, a systematic simulation study is conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the parameter estimates and the performance of five test statistics including the naive statistic derived from normal distribution based maximum likelihood (ML), the Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square statistic (RML), the mean- and variance-adjusted chi-square statistic (AML), Yuan-Bentler residual-based test statistic (CRADF), and Yuan-Bentler residual-based F statistic (RF). Data are generated and analyzed in R using the package rsem (Yuan {\&} Zhang, 2011b). Based on the simulation study, we can observe the following: (a) The traditional normal distribution-based method cannot yield accurate parameter estimates for nonnormal data, whereas the robust method obtains much more accurate model parameter estimates for nonnormal data and performs almost as well as the normal distribution based method for normal distributed data. (b) With the increase of sample size, or the decrease of missing rate or the number of outliers, the parameter estimates are less biased and the empirical distributions of test statistics are closer to their nominal distributions. (c) The ML test statistic does not work well for nonnormal or missing data. (d) For nonnormal complete data, CRADF and RF work relatively better than RML and AML. (e) For missing completely at random (MCAR) missing data, in almost all the cases, RML and AML work better than CRADF and RF. (f) For nonnormal missing at random (MAR) missing data, CRADF and RF work better than AML. (g) The performance of the robust method does not seem to be influenced by the symmetry of outliers.

abstract = {Missing data are a pervasive problem in many psychological applications in the real world. In this article we study the impact of dropout on the operational characteristics of several approaches that can be easily implemented with commercially available software. These approaches include the covariance pattern model based on an unstructured covariance matrix (CPM-U) and the true covariance matrix (CPM-T), multiple imputation-based generalized estimating equations (MI-GEE), and weighted generalized estimating equations (WGEE). Under the missing at random mechanism, the MI-GEE approach was always robust. The CPM-T and CPM-U methods were also able to control the error rates provided that certain minimum sample size requirements were met, whereas the WGEE was more prone to inflated error rates. In contrast, under the missing not at random mechanism, all evaluated approaches were generally invalid. Our results also indicate that the CPM methods were more powerful than the MI-GEE and WGEE methods and their superiority was often substantial. Furthermore, we note that little or no power was sacrificed by using CPM-U method in place of CPM-T, although both methods have less power in situations where some participants have incomplete data. Some aspects of the CPM-U and MI-GEE methods are illustrated using real data from 2 previously published data sets. The first data set comes from a randomized study of AIDS patients with advanced immune suppression, the second from a cohort of patients with schizotypal personality disorder enrolled in a prevention program for psychosis.

The study also investigated the impact of using different estimation strategies for information criteria, the impact of different adjustments for calculating the criteria, and the impact of different distribution shapes. Overall, we found that the ability of consistent criteria in any of the their examined forms to select the correct model was superior under simple covariance patterns than under complex covariance patterns, and vice versa for the efficient criteria. The simulation studies covered in this paper also revealed that, regardless of method of estimation used, the consistent criteria based on number of subjects were more effective than the consistent criteria based on total number of observations, and vice versa for the efficient criteria. Furthermore, results indicated that, given a dataset with missing values, the efficient criteria were more affected than the consistent criteria by the lack of normality.},

abstract = {As a procedure for handling missing data, Multiple imputation consists of estimating the missing data multiple times to create several complete versions of an incomplete data set. All these data sets are analyzed by the same statistical procedure, and the results are pooled for interpretation. So far, no explicit rules for pooling F tests of (repeated-measures) analysis of variance have been defined. In this article we outline the appropriate procedure for the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiply imputed data sets. It involves both reformulation of the ANOVA model as a regression model using effect coding of the predictors and applying already existing combination rules for regression models. The proposed procedure is illustrated using 3 example data sets. The pooled results of these 3 examples provide plausible F and p values. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

abstract = {Missing data are a common practical problem for longitudinal designs. Time-series analysis is a longitudinal method that involves a large number of observations on a single unit. Four different missing-data methods (deletion, mean substitution, mean of adjacent observations, and maximum likelihood estimation) were evaluated. Computer-generated time-series data of length 100 were generated for 50 different conditions representing five levels of autocorrelation, two levels of slope, and five levels of proportion of missing data. Methods were compared with respect to the accuracy of estimation for four parameters (level, error variance, degree of autocorrelation, and slope). The choice of method had a major impact on the analysis. The maximum likelihood very accurately estimated all four parameters under all conditions tested. The mean of the series was the least accurate approach. Statistical methods such as the maximum likelihood procedure represent a superior approach to missing data.

abstract = {Comments on the article by Hershberger and Fisher (see record [rid]2003-08838-009[/rid]). Multiple imputation is an increasingly popular strategy for analyzing data with missing values. In multiple imputation, the analyst creates several different versions of a data set, replacing missing values with plausible random values, or imputations. Recently Hershberger and Fisher argued that several hundred imputations are often required. The established advice, however, is that 2 to 10 imputations suffice under most realistic circumstances. In this note we review evidence for the established advice, and explain why it is unnecessary and sometimes impractical to use hundreds of imputations. The authors asserted that the usual guidance is based exclusively on Monte Carlo simulations. The authors arrived at a different recommendation, but there are some difficulties with their approach. Their analysis does not include the fraction of missing information. This omission implies that the appropriate number of imputations is the same whether the sample is 1 {\%} or 99{\%} missing. The authors' analysis uses sampling formulas and is based on the assumption that, for example, "it is desired to determine the number of imputations such that the predicted number of imputations differs by no more than 10{\%} from its 'true' value."

abstract = {Due to the chaotic nature of the clinical disorder, longitudinal data analysis in substance abuse research is plagued by missing values. To obtain an unbiased estimation on intervention effects, different longitudinal modeling strategies require various assumptions on the patterns and mechanisms of missing data. By defining missingness as intermittent missingness (occasional omission) and dropout (premature withdrawal), this article demonstrates statistical ways for assessing missing data assumptions using evidence from a clinical trial. Within the framework of multiple imputation, intermittent missing data are imputed first so that dropouts can be isolated and treated specifically. A computational tool called "pattern reduction resampling" is proposed to simplify missing data methods when the number of intra-subject repeated measures is large. To test whether missingness patterns are nondifferential across treatment conditions, a formal testing approach treats indicators of missingness as a special type of repeated measures (e.g., 0: intermittent missing, 1: observed, and 2: dropout missing). After reviewing the idea of ignorability for missing data and of classifying missingness mechanisms into subcategories, the article provides an example for assessing common assumptions on missingness mechanisms and how these assumptions affect model selection for significance testing. A carbon monoxide longitudinal data set in a smoking cessation study is used for illustration.},

Understanding NMAR mechanism in a data set would allow one to better use the ML methodology. A survey or questionnaire may contain many items; certain items may be responsible for NMAR values in other items. The paper develops statistical procedures to identify the responsible items. By comparing ML estimates (MLE), statistics are developed to test whether the MLEs are changed when excluding items. The items that cause a significant change of the MLEs are responsible for the NMAR mechanism. Normal distribution is used for obtaining the MLEs; a sandwich-type covariance matrix is used to account for distribution violations. The class of non normal distributions within which the procedure is valid is provided. Both saturated and structural models are considered. Effect sizes are also defined and studied. The results indicate that more missing data in a sample does not necessarily imply more significant test statistics due to smaller effect sizes. Knowing the true population means and covariances or the parameter values in structural equation models may not make things easier either.

It provides important information on whether a commonly used multivariate procedure is appropriate for inference. Many statistical packages also have options for missing data. However, there is no procedure for applying Mardia's kurtosis to a data set with missing values. In this article Mardia's kurtosis is extended to a data set with missing values. Based on the complete data counterpart, the behavior of a standardized version of the extended sample kurtosis can be described by the standard normal distribution. Analytical and Monte-Carlo studies imply that the proposed distribution description is as good as its complete data counterpart when missing variables are either missing completely at random or missing at random when observed marginals do not sit in a cluster with a restricted range. Application of this procedure is illustrated with a real data set. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

The validity of this procedure does not require the assumption of a normally distributed population. When the population is normally distributed and all missing data are missing at random (MAR), the direct ML procedure is nearly optimal for SEM with missing data. When missing data mechanisms are unknown, including auxiliary variables in the analysis will make the missing data mechanism more likely to be MAR. It is much easier to include auxiliary variables in the 2-stage ML than in the direct ML. Based on most recent developments for missing data with an unknown population distribution, the article first provides the least technical material on why the normal distribution-based ML generates consistent parameter estimates when the missing data mechanism is MAR. The article also provides sufficient conditions for the 2-stage ML to be a valid statistical procedure in the general case. For the application of the 2-stage ML, an SAS IML program is given to perform the first-stage analysis and EQS codes are provided to perform the second-stage analysis. An example with open- and closed-book examination data is used to illustrate the application of the provided programs. One aim is for quantitative graduate students/applied psychometricians to understand the technical details for missing data analysis. Another aim is for applied researchers to use the method properly. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {The paper develops a two-stage robust procedure for structural equation modeling (SEM) and an R package rsem to facilitate the use of the procedure by applied researchers. In the first stage, M-estimates of the saturated mean vector and covariance matrix of all variables are obtained. Those corresponding to the substantive variables are then fitted to the structural model in the second stage. A sandwich-type covariance matrix is used to obtain consistent standard errors (SE) of the structural parameter estimates. Rescaled, adjusted as well as corrected and F-statistics are proposed for overall model evaluation. Using R and EQS, the R package rsem combines the two stages and generates all the test statistics and consistent SEs. Following the robust analysis, multiple model fit indices and standardized solutions are provided in the corresponding output of EQS. An example with open/closed book examination data illustrates the proper use of the package. The method is further applied to the analysis of a data set from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 cohort, and results show that the developed procedure not only gives a better endorsement of the substantive models but also yields estimates with uniformly smaller standard errors than the normal-distribution-based maximum likelihood.

abstract = {Many statistical models, e.g. regression models, can be viewed as conditional moment restrictions when distributional assumptions on the error term are not assumed. For such models, several estimators that achieve the semiparametric efficiency bound have been proposed. However, in many studies, auxiliary information is available as unconditional moment restrictions. Meanwhile, we also consider the presence of missing responses. We propose the combined empirical likelihood (CEL) estimator to incorporate such auxiliary information to improve the estimation efficiency of the conditional moment restriction models. We show that, when assuming responses are strongly ignorable missing at random, the CEL estimator achieves better efficiency than the previous estimators due to utilization of the auxiliary information. Based on the asymptotic property of the CEL estimator, we also develop Wilks' type tests and corresponding confidence regions for the model parameter and the mean response. Since kernel smoothing is used, the CEL method may have difficulty for problems with high dimensional covariates. In such situations, we propose an instrumental variable-based empirical likelihood (IVEL) method to handle this problem. The merit of the CEL and IVEL are further illustrated through simulation studies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

abstract = {Despite wide applications of both mediation models and missing data techniques, formal discussion of mediation analysis with missing data is still rare. We introduce and compare four approaches to dealing with missing data in mediation analysis including listwise deletion, pairwise deletion, multiple imputation (MI), and a two-stage maximum likelihood (TS-ML) method. An R package bmem is developed to implement the four methods for mediation analysis with missing data in the structural equation modeling framework, and two real examples are used to illustrate the application of the four methods. The four methods are evaluated and compared under MCAR, MAR, and MNAR missing data mechanisms through simulation studies. Both MI and TS-ML perform well for MCAR and MAR data regardless of the inclusion of auxiliary variables and for AV-MNAR data with auxiliary variables. Although listwise deletion and pairwise deletion have low power and large parameter estimation bias in many studied conditions, they may provide useful information for exploring missing mechanisms.

abstract = {Most dimension reduction techniques produce ordered coordinates so that only the first few coordinates need be considered in subsequent analyses. The choice of how many coordinates to use is often made with a visual heuristic, i.e., by making a scree plot and looking for a “big gap” or an “elbow.” In this article, we present a simple and automatic procedure to accomplish this goal by maximizing a simple profile likelihood function. We give a wide variety of both simulated and real examples.},

abstract = {This work presents an application of the EM algorithm to two problems of estimation and testing in a multivariate normal distribution with missing data. The assumptions are that the observations are multivariate normally distributed and that the missing values are missing at random. The two models are tested applying the log-likelihood ratio test; for deriving the maximum likelihood estimates and evaluating the corresponding log-likelihood functions the EM algorithm is used. The problem of different and non-monotone patterns of missing data is solved introducing suitable transformations and partitions of the data matrix. The algorithm is proposed for general constraints on the mean vector; the topic of exchangeability of random vectors is also presented. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).
